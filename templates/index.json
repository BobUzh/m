Skin-to-skin and lengthy naps help your own body produce oxytocin, the feel-good love hormone, which may help sustain your own nervous system and in turn directly support and regulate your baby’s sensorium. Our focus for this week’s menu is on continuing to balance your milk supply while including all of the vitamins and minerals your body needs to support your baby’s developing brain. <\/p>"
